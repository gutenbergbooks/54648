</div>

<p class='c012'>It was a bitterly cold night in March.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bleak, gloomy streets of Chicago were almost deserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A poor little boy in rags was slinking along an aristocratic
avenue, shivering with the cold and looking very
wretched.</p>

<p class='c000'>His pallid, emaciated face showed poverty and privation,
an air of utter misery surrounded him, and he had a mournful
look in his sunken eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody noticed poor Joe Crosby but the police.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was then only one of the many waifs of the great city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Reynard, the detective, had seen him stealing along
like a thief, and the zealous officer became so suspicious of
the boy’s actions that he began to follow him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps he was justified in doing this, for the hoodlums
of Chicago were a pretty bad set of rowdies, as a rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective was a middle aged, sharp, shrewd fellow,
of medium size, clad in a black suit and derby hat, his bony
face clean shaven, his keen blue eyes snapping with fire,
and his reputation for ability the very finest.</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept the skulking boy well in view and was a little
bit startled to see him mount the stoop of a very handsome
brown stone house, through the parlor windows of which,
partly open at the top, there gleamed a dull light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of the poor little wretch making an attempt to
break into the house as the detective expected, he boldly rang
the bell.</p>

<p class='c000'>A servant answered the summons, and, seeing the boy,
she cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! Joe Crosby—you back home again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Nora,” the boy replied, in firm tones, “and I am
going to stay, too. My stepfather, Martin Murdock, is a
wicked man. He lured me to a wretched tenement in West
Randolph street, where an Italian villain has been keeping
me a prisoner. But after a month of captivity I escaped
from there to-night, and now I have come back to make
Martin Murdock tell me why he did this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, the rascal!” indignantly cried the girl. “He told
us that he sent you off to boarding-school. Come in, Joe,
come in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is my stepfather in the house?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; you will find him in the front parlor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy entered the mansion and disappeared from the
detective’s view.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Reynard vented a whistle expressive of intense astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke!” he muttered. “Here’s a daisy game!
Never thought I was going to drop onto a family affair of
this kind. Wonder if I could hear what goes on in the
parlor if I get up on the stoop?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that the parlor windows were partly open at the
top, and mounting the stairs he crouched in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Joe had gone into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A well-built man, in stylish clothing, stood in the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Martin Murdock.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was apparently about forty years of age and wore a
black mustache, had dark hair and black eyes, an aquiline
nose, and upon his left cheek a V-shaped, livid scar.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of astonishment escaped his lips when he saw the
boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Free!” he gasped. “How did you get away, you
whelp?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my business,” the boy replied, angrily. “You
must explain why you had me imprisoned in that vile den.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I must, eh?” sneered the man, with a nasty leer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have thought it over,” said Joe, sharply. “You was
a poor man when you married my mother. When she died
I know that she left me a large fortune, for I heard the lawyer
read her will. You was made my guardian until I
come of age, in five years. Now there was one point in the
will that would make you wish to see me dead. That was
the clause which said you would inherit all my money if I
were to die before I am twenty-one. Are you trying to
put me out of the way so you can get that money, Martin
Murdock?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked the man squarely in the eyes as he asked this
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock quailed before his victim’s reproachful burning
glance for Joe had correctly surmised the dark plot he had
in view.</p>

<p class='c000'>His nervousness only lasted a moment for he quickly recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fool!” he hissed, getting enraged at the thought that
his wicked scheme was suspected. “How dare you hint that
I’d do such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because I know you are a villain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” roared Murdock, furiously. “You insult me.
I’ll pound the life out of you, you infernal young
scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And he sprang at the boy and dealt him a savage blow
that knocked him over upon the floor, rushed up to him
and began to kick him about the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Weak from past privations, and unable to defend himself,
poor Joe groaned in a heart-rending manner, and cried,
piteously, as the hot tears ran down his pale, thin cheeks:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, don’t—don’t, Mr. Murdock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll kill you!” yelled the brute.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For pity’s sake! Oh, the pain! Stop—I can’t stand
it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the servant rushed in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shame!” she cried, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get out of here!” roared Murdock. “I’ll discharge
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you beat poor Joe any more I’ll have you arrested!”
This threat caused the broker to say, hastily:</p>

<p class='c000'>“He provoked me to it. I don’t intend to hit him again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Satisfied with this assurance, the girl went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Joe, cut, bleeding and black-and-blue, crept toward
the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man glared at him a moment and then hissed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get up, there! Get up, I say! I’ll have a final settlement
with you! Put on your hat. It is eight o’clock now.
The lawyer who has charge of your money has gone home.
He lives out of town. You come with me to his house.
You’ll get your money. Then you can clear out of here
and never trouble me again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gladly!” exclaimed Joe, in eager tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that with plenty of money he could easily get
along in the world and be under no obligations to this fiend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock scowled at him and prepared to go out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing them coming the detective left the stoop and got
behind an adjacent tree where he was unseen.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had scarcely concealed himself when he saw Martin
Murdock come out with Joe, hail a passing cab, get in and
ride away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective had overheard all they said in the parlor,
and with his suspicions of the broker aroused, he pursued
the cab, resolved to see the termination of the affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock did not utter a word to the boy, but kept watching
him and deeply thinking over a dark scheme he had in
view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy feared this man, but he was so eager to have a
final settlement with him that he did not hesitate to go
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching the railroad depot they embarked on a train.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll take him to an unfrequented place and put an end
to him!” thought Murdock, grimly. “He stands in my way
to nearly a million. The stakes are enormous. It is worth
the risk. I’m bound to have the money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Unluckily for him, the detective was on the same train.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were whirled away.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Several hours passed by, when the end of the road was
reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Readestown! All out! Last stop!” called the conductor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock and the boy were the only ones in that car, and
they arose, alighted and strode away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Reynard pursued them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place was a noted little city in which dwelt a celebrated
young inventor named Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>Skirting the suburbs of the city, Murdock led his victim
toward a magnificent big mansion in which dwelt the inventor
alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the extensive grounds surrounding the house were a
number of immense workshops, in which the inventor constructed
his marvelous contrivances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s where the lawyer lives,” Murdock said to the
boy, as he pointed at the mansion, although he had never
been in Readestown before.</p>

<p class='c000'>This information allayed any suspicions the poor boy
might have had, and as the surroundings were isolated, the
place seemed to favor the murderous design the man had
in view.</p>

<p class='c000'>They strode toward the mansion and paused at the gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You wait here for me,” said Murdock. “I’ll go in and
see if the lawyer is home. I’ll call you in if I find him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” the boy replied, in low, sad tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>He leaned against the gate post with an oppressive feeling
at heart and the gloomiest forebodings in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It almost seemed as if he had a subtle premonition of his
fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock entered the grounds and stole away in the shrubbery.</p>

<p class='c000'>He came to a pause and listened intently, then keenly
peered around without hearing or seeing anybody.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wretch was intensely excited and as pale as death,
while upon his brow there stood great beads of perspiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>He fully realized what he was going to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not an extenuating thing to excuse him.</p>

<p class='c000'>From where he crouched he could plainly see the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew a revolver from his hip-pocket, his hand shaking
as if palsied, and deliberately aimed at the poor boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, God, I’m shot!” shrieked Joe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock rushed to his victim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor little Joe fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The assassin thrust the pistol in his stiffening fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He designed to lend the crime an appearance of suicide.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Tom Reynard had seen the whole deed, and came
rushing up to the villain and his victim, too late to stop the
crime or be of any service.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You murderer!” cried the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m caught!” hoarsely muttered Murdock.</p>

<p class='c000'>He struck the detective with the pistol, knocked him
senseless, and hearing footsteps approaching he rushed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down from the house rushed Frank Reade, Jr., alarmed
by the pistol shot, and seeing the detective was stunned he
knelt down beside the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Joe was dead, to all appearances.</p>

  <h2 id='II' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ENGINE OF THE CLOUDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Frank Reade, Jr., was a dashing young man of distinguished
appearance, attired in fashionable clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was noted for his wonderful skill at inventing electrical
and mechanical wonders of various kinds.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this work he was ably assisted by a diminutive negro,
named Pomp, and a rollicking, red-headed Irishman, called
Barney O’Shea, who invariably were his traveling companions
on the trips he made with his inventions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judging that the boy was beyond all recovery, and deeming
it wisest to pay first attention to the living, Frank lifted
the detective up and carried him into the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>He met the coon and the Celt running toward him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gorramighty!” panted Pomp. “Wha’ de trouble, Marsa
Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I found this senseless man and a dead boy at the gate
just now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, it’s a bloody murdher, then!” exclaimed
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So it seems. Help me in with this fellow till we revive
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They carried Reynard into the sitting-room, laid him
down, and seeing his badge, discovered that he was a detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>Restoratives were applied and he began to revive, upon
observing which Frank went out to get the dead boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he reached the gate, to his amazement he found
that the body of little Joe Crosby had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank hunted all over, but failed to find it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Completely at a loss to account for the mysterious disappearance,
he returned to the house and told his friends
about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reynard had recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sitting on the sofa, he heard that the body was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he told Frank and his friends what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>As soon as they heard the story they realized that a brutal
crime had been perpetrated by an avaricious, unscrupulous
rascal, who ought to be punished for his sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d better apprise the local authorities of the deed and
the strange loss of the body,” said Frank, briskly. “In the
meantime, Mr. Reynard, you had better try to find Martin
Murdock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! Here’s a daisy game!” the detective replied.
“Your head’s level, Mr. Reade. I’m off. You’ll
hear from me again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And away he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank followed him out.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to inform the police.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then nearly eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had been in the workshop putting the
finishing touches on a new flying machine Frank invented.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything was completed, but in their hurried exit they
had left the electric arc lights lit in the shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the inventor was gone the Irishman said to Pomp:</p>

<p class='c000'>“D’yer moind yer wor afther lavin’ ther loights lit in ther
shop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Me?” said the coon. “G’way! ‘Twarn’t me, honey.
Yo’ done it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go an’ turrun thim out, naygur!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Won’t do nuffin’ ob de kine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Neither will I, me jewel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When Marse Frank come back he gwine ter git mad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, you’re a dead man, then, fer I’ll blame it on you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ I’se gwine ter say dat yo’ done did it, chile.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ther two av us will get it in ther neck, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dunno ‘bout dat, I’ish,” said Pomp. “If I’se got ter
go, yo’ go, too!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so saying, he suddenly grabbed Barney by the nape
of his neck and the slack of his pants, and rushed him into
the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away they scudded across the garden toward the shops,
the Irishman unable to stop himself, and Pomp grinning
and chuckling over the advantage he had gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whoop!” yelled Barney, as his legs flew along. “Begorry,
I’ll have yer scalp fer this, ye puckered-up hyaena!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cl’ar de track!” roared the delighted coon. “Heah
come de cyclone! Golly, what a roast, Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Propelling the Celt before him, he reached the half-closed
door of the shop, slammed Barney against it with a bang,
causing it to fly open, and barked his nose on the panel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdher!” raved the Celt. “Faix, me bugle is
bushted!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put on de brakes!” howled the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he hauled off with his big foot and gave a Barney
a boost that landed him on his ear in the middle of the big
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unluckily for the dusky practical joker he tripped over
a plank and landed on top of the Irishman with a thud.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment Barney had him by the leg, dragged
him over to a tackle hanging from the wall, secured the
hook around the coon’s ankle and hoisted him up by the
rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Pomp’s woolly head cleared the ground Barney tied
the rope to a cleat and picked up a barrel stave.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Watch me droive him troo ther wall!” he roared.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now his turn to chuckle and laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp began to look sick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around swished the stave over the coon’s coat-tail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>Plunk!</p>

<p class='c000'>Thump!</p>

<p class='c000'>For reports like pistol shots pealed out as Barney brought
the stave down upon the coon’s anatomy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A bellow ripped from between Pomp’s thick, blubbery
lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de Lawd’s sake, stop dat!” he yelled, frenetically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yer will ploog me wid yer fut, hey?” roared Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he soaked the coon again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Biff!</p>

<p class='c000'>Boom!</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp squirmed, roared, and suddenly grabbed his tormentor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unfasten me dar!” he howled, as he pinched the Irishman.
“If yo’ doan done it I’se gwine ter chaw yer, honey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holt on!” yelled Barney, in tones of agony. “Bad cess
to yer, it’s a choonk yez will take out av me entoirely. Lave
aff, yer bottle-nosed gorilla, or I’ll go around on a crootch!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir! No, sir! Not’ll yo’ luf me down yere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis! Yis!” howled Barney, complying. “Ouch, me
leg! Whoo—oh—oh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The moment Barney let go the rope he tore himself free
and rushed out of the shop, pursued by the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the middle of the big room stood Frank’s new invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was formed like a sharp-prowed ship, and was made
of aluminum.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an air-rudder at the bow and a water-screw
and rudder at the stern, while the deck was railed in.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the bow projected a long ram, while at the stern
were two enormous air-propellers, one larger than the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Two turrets crowned the deck, with tubes rising from
their roofs, on top of which were a pair of tremendous
helices.</p>

<p class='c000'>From one tube to the other ran two more horizontal
tubes, between which were ranged five more big helices.</p>

<p class='c000'>These helices were revolved, as were the other wheels, by
a strong current of electricity, to lift the engine up in the
air.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the forward turret, which was designed for the steersman,
stood a powerful electric searchlight, and in the midship
section a circular deck-house, pierced by doors and
bull’s-eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a remarkable-looking machine, the material and
mechanism of which combined extreme lightness with the
greatest of strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank had built other flying machines with mechanical
parts similar to those employed in this one, which had
proven successful, he was sure this one would operate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor had returned from police headquarters
when Pomp chased Barney out into the yard, and
going between the practical jokers he separated them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both were forced to shake hands and go to bed, and the
inventor turned out the lights and followed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following day Frank received reports from the
police, from time to time, but nothing was found of the
missing body of poor little Joe Crosby.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward nightfall Tom Reynard returned to Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made his way at once to Frank’s house, and meeting
the celebrated inventor in his library, he asked him:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, have you found the corpse?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. The police have hunted all over but failed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How strange! Suppose some one stole it—probably
medical students, who want it for dissection. I’ve got bad
news.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” asked Frank, curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Learned that Martin Murdock returned to Chicago last
night. To-day he drew a small fortune in money from his
bank, went to New York and started for Europe in the
trans-Atlantic steamer Red Star.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So he escaped you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. He knows that his crime is exposed, and wants to
escape arrest. He’s got plenty money to do it, too. But
I’ve telegraphed on to Liverpool to the police to hold him
on a charge of murder. I’ve got a warrant to arrest him
on that charge and am going after him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He may suspect your design, and give you the slip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I know. Such a daisy game has been played before.
But it’s the best I can do,” said the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know a surer way than that to catch him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How? How?” eagerly asked Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Chase him in my new flying machine. Heard of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. The papers mentioned that you had such an invention.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My interest in the case is excited. Do you want to
do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d be delighted, if you’ll allow me to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I want a use to put the engine of the clouds to, and
as this is a good one I’ll see if I can’t aid the ends of justice
with the machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! When shall we start?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The day after to-morrow. As we can make one hundred
miles an hour through the sky in her, we are bound to soon
overhaul the steamer. We have only to provision and equip
the engine now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The four set to work at once on the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the second day she was ready, and they all embarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank entered the forward turret, the machinery was
started, the helices whirled, and the engine arose and passed
through the open roof of the shop and shot up into the sky.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>A STOWAWAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The sun was going down in the west when the Pegasus,
as the engine of the clouds was named, rose above Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her seven big helices were whirling around with a loud,
buzzing sound, and lifting her at the rate of a yard a
second.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shout arose from the people thronging the streets
when they observed the flight of the engine, and as the news
spread, every one in the city watched the ascension with
deep interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had gone into the deck-house and hastened
below to watch the working of the machinery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Left alone on deck, the detective observed that the Pegasus
rode as steadily as if she rested on flanges upon the
ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a height of 2,000 feet Frank slackened the speed of
the helices until they whirled just fast enough to hold the
engine at the desired altitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective then joined him in the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! This is a daisy contrivance!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She works just as I designed she should,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Drive her out over the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the teeth of this gale?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were several levers in front of the steering wheel
beside the compass binnacle, and Frank pulled one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like the rest this lever was connected with the machinery,
and it made an electrical circuit with the driving screw
motor, causing them to rotate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The screws acted upon the air as a metal propeller does
in the water, and the engine glided ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced at several dials on the wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>They registered, measured and gauged the different parts
of the airship, while various other instruments kept the
temperature, gave the altitude, velocity of the wind and
so on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is marvelous!” the detective cried, enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can feel her advance against the wind,” said Frank,
“but when we are going with it at the rate of one hundred
miles an hour you would scarcely think we were moving.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can you go with the wind?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, the atmospheric envelope of the earth consists of
numerous stratas, or air currents that blow in all directions,”
replied Frank. “If I were in a balloon and had no
means of guidance but plenty ballast and lots of gas I
could steer it as well as if I had a rudder. This could be
done by alternately raising or lowering the balloon into
currents of air blowing in the directions I wished to pursue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t that queer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is perfectly natural. Now there is a strata called
the Solar Current, which blows constantly from the west to
the east at a very high altitude. I could send a balloon
completely around the world by remaining poised in that
current. As it is so high up, however, we cannot make use
of it, for we would be at such a great elevation we could
not see the steamer Red Star if we met it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Barney came in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How is the machinery?” Frank asked him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, it do be wurkin’ as shlick as a phwistle!” replied
the Celt. “An’ I suspishey that she’ll be afther gallopin’
troo ther clouds beyant wid the agility av a kangaroo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take charge of the wheel and hold her due east. I’ll
run down below and observe the actions of her dynamo and
machinery myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He beckoned the detective to follow him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Barney steering, they went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The panorama of the landscape below looked like an
enormous oil painting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything took on the most diminutive size, and in the
far distance they caught sight of the great lakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intense solitude was occasionally broken by the shrill
blasts of steam whistles in factories and locomotives, the
clang of bells and other loud, distinct sounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few high-flying birds were seen circling around not
far away, and a strong wind was vainly opposing the engine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing into the deck-house Frank and the detective
found themselves in a room used for a cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one side stood a row of bunks, and at the other a
staircase leading down below.</p>

<p class='c000'>A door in the partition gave access to a combined kitchen
and dining saloon over which Pomp presided as cook.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every room was fitted up with incandescent electric
lamps and pony motor fan-wheels, while the furnishing was
luxurious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Descending the stairs they found themselves in the hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was divided into three compartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one forward was a general storeroom for tools, arms,
ammunition, duplicate parts of the engine and similar
things; the next room contained food and water enough
for a long trip, and the rear compartment held the machinery.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a simple arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The base of each helix shaft was furnished with a powerful
motor which only required an electric current to turn it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This current was derived from a small, light dynamo,
which in turn was operated by an oil engine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same engine and dynamo gave power to the electric
lighting machine, and a large motor connected with the
machinery which revolved the screw shaft.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should the occasion require, the power could be turned
into a small motor, to which the water screw was coupled,
for work in the sea, if they desired to navigate the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was busy oiling the bearings when Frank and his
companion entered the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney says everything is satisfactory, Pomp,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spec’s it am, sah,” grinned the coon. “She done buck
de win’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Like a battering ram. I’ll examine her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ shuah, honey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor began his inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not looked far before he received a tremendous
shock of surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crouching in a corner behind a barrel of oil he caught
sight of a man, who, by some means, had stowed himself
away on the engine.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By thunder, a stowaway!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke!” gasped Reynard. “Here’s a daisy game!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de Lawd sake, whar am he?” demanded Pomp, in
startled tones.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Frank pounced upon the man, caught him by the back
of the neck and hauled him out of his covert.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of alarm escaped the fellow upon finding himself
discovered, and he rose to his feet with a scared look.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a man of about thirty, attired in a seedy suit of
clothes, a dilapidated stove-pipe hat, and wore a brown beard
and mustache.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh!” he roared, struggling to break away from Frank.
“Don’t touch me. I’m crazy! Look out! I bite! Ha!
ha! See the demons. The air is full of them! Back, you
imps, back I say!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He put up his fists and began to punch wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cynical smile crossed Frank’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you’re looney, eh?” he asked, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Completely off my base!” asserted the man, confidentially.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You lie! You are simply pretending to be a crank in
order to avoid punishment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a daisy game!” laughed the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, but you’re mistaken!” said the man, in injured
tones. “I just escaped from the asylum. I’m a dead bug;
on the level, I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What induced you to enter my shop and stow yourself
away aboard of this airship—a desire to navigate the
clouds?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied the stranger. “You carried me up before
I could get off again. I—hey! Give me that——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is this book?” queried Frank, hauling it out of
the man’s pocket and glancing at the pages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man strove to snatch it away, but Frank was too
quick for him and prevented it.</p>

<p class='c000'>One glance at the contents was enough for him—the book
was filled with drawings of the mechanism of the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s a thief!” cried Frank, flushing with indignation.
“He has simply come aboard to steal my patents. Here
is the proof!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He held up the book to the view of his companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man slunk back with a scowl of alarm on his face,
for he realized that his real motive was betrayed, and that
all the contradictions he could make would be of no avail in
the face of such damaging evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment a deep silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy snake!” ejaculated the detective. “That’s a daisy
game!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frow de dirty white trash overboard!” indignantly
roared Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank tore the book to pieces and flung the fragments
out one of the windows, after which he turned to the man
and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your treachery shall be severely punished, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I’m a maniac!” protested the fellow, in a vain attempt
to convince them that he was not accountable for his
actions. “I’m covered with snakes! Take ‘em off! Don’t
you see ‘em squirming?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank caught him by the neck, interrupting him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That will do!” he cried, angrily. “Insane people don’t
usually do such very practical and profitable things as you
have done. Consider yourself my prisoner, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll be hanged if I will!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t escape from here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t, eh? Well, I’ll own the engine!”</p>

<p class='c000'>As he said this a desperate light leaped into his eyes and
he pulled a knife from his breast-pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Making a rush at Frank he aimed a stab at him, which
the young inventor barely had time to avoid by stepping
back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp picked up an iron bar and the detective drew his
revolver and aimed it at the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the peril he was in the rascal rushed for the
stairs, pursued by the three, and dashed up to the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out on deck he ran like a deer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his companions followed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He headed for the pilot-house, and flinging open the door
he dashed into the room behind Barney.</p>

<p class='c012'>Barney heard the man rush into the room, and glancing
around he was thunderstruck to see the stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, his amazement was increased by observing that
the man had a wild, hunted look on his face and a knife in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, it’s a stranger!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you budge an inch I’ll run this knife in your heart!”
hissed the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, I’ll not boodge a quarther av an inch!” replied
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell your friends to keep back or you are a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shtand back as far as ther sturrun, fellies!” roared
Barney. “Ther further back yez goes ther safer me loife
will be!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his companions heard this cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>It brought them to a pause, for they realized that Barney
was in danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>A consultation was held to devise a means of getting the
man into their power and saving Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See here,” said the stranger to the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“I’m luckin’, yer honor,” replied the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lower the engine to the ground so I can alight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will; only kape that knife away. Begorry, it makes
a cowld chill floy up an’ down me backbone whin ther p’int
tooches me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Barney slackened the revolutions of the helices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine began to rapidly descend.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short time she was near the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now tell your friends to enter the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Masther Frank, dear!” roared Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go beyant inter ther cabin, d’yer moind?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This spalpeen do be wishin’ to escape wid no bullets in
him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is your life in danger, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, I’m widin wan inch av bein’ a coorpse!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we’ll go in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go, and God bless yer sowl!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his companions returned to the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peering out the door the stowaway saw that the coast was
clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you attempt to turn your head before I am off this
engine,” said he, in threatening tones, “I’ll cut your heart
out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, I have a shtiff neck, an’ couldn’t turrun it if I
thried!” lied Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man shook his knife at Barney, and glided out on
deck, for by this time the machine was within a few feet
of the open ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner was he out of the room when as quick as a
flash Barney turned a heavy current of electricity into the
boat’s hull.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She’s electrified!” he yelled to his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>They heard, and understood him, and remained in the
cabin out of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not so the stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>His shoes insulated his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no sooner did he grasp the railing to go overboard
when he received a powerful shock that made him yell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both hands grasped the railing, convulsively, and he
could not let go.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh! Ouch! Oh-h-h-h!” he yelled, wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, I have him!” roared Barney, delightedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop it!” screamed the stranger. “I’m a dead man!
I’m a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, I’ll take yer measure for a coffin!” chuckled
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let up there, will you? Oh! oh! oh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit! It’s electrocuted I’ll have yez in wan
minute!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man raved, swore, begged and wept.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney kept the current on, though.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Frank cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That will do. He’s punished enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll let him go, then,” returned the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He cut out the current.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the stowaway found himself relieved he gave a
jump, flew over the rail and landing on the ground below
he rolled over and over in the dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting upon his feet he sped away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and the rest then emerged from the cabin and
Barney sent the machine up in the air again.</p>

<p class='c000'>She resumed her journey and the man below was soon
lost to view in a woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fer ther love av hiven, what do it all be manin’?” asked
the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was a stowaway, stealing my patent,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Troth, an’ it wuz a blackguard he made av himself, entoirely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He didn’t gain anything by his rascality.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How hoigh up shall I be afther sindin’ the Pegasus?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One thousand feet will do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s that same now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then drive her ahead!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney complied, and by nightfall they reached the ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>A watch was maintained for the steamer Red Star all
night, and the engine of the clouds mounted higher to
avoid a rain storm, and sped along on the course of European
bound vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several craft were seen during the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>But none was the steamer they sought.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning Pomp cooked a dainty breakfast
for them and all hands went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were then over 500 miles from land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Below them stretched an endless expanse of water, while
above the sky was clear and blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had assumed control of the wheel, and the engine
floated half a mile above the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was making eighty miles an hour, and going with a
strong breeze from the southwest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective was an inveterate smoker, and having lit a
fragrant cigar, was puffing away at it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How far are we from the steamer?” he asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From three to four hundred miles,” the inventor replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how long will it take to gain that distance?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“About ten hours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you think we will meet the Red Star to-day?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Very likely by six o’clock to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She will be nearly half way across the ocean——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, not more than quarter the distance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This news seemed to please the detective very much.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are bound to catch Martin Murdock before he reaches
the other side, it seems!” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Provided no accident occurs to prevent it. How strange
that poor little Joe Crosby’s body disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have an opinion about that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdock was probably lurking near the spot where the
boy fell, shot. When you took me into the house he probably
returned, carried the corpse away and hid it in order
to conceal the evidence of his crime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a reasonable supposition, but how did you secure
the warrant for the man’s arrest?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By swearing that I saw him murder the boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you witness the deed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I stood only fifty feet away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we will have no trouble to take him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Barney came out and joined them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He carried an old fiddle upon which he was used to playing,
and struck up a lively reel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had a banjo in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing the scraping of the violin he fastened the wheel,
and picking up the instrument he began to play a rattling
accompaniment to the Irishman’s tune.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be ther hokey this is foine!” chuckled Barney, with
a grin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bress de lamb!” roared Pomp, in the turret. “Saw
away dar, honey, saw away! I’se a-plunkin’, I is, an’ dar
am gwin fo’ ter be music in de air if dis yere coon knows
heself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, it’s out av tune yez are entoirely!” cried the Celt.
“G’way, chile! Dis ole pianner am all right. Yo’ bettah
go learn how ter scrape dat dar ole caliope befo’ yo’
done try ter play tunes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Watch me rattle ther spalpeen!” grinned Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>He suddenly changed the reel into a slow hymn, and no
sooner did the coon change his accompaniment when the
Celt switched off into a waltz.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before Pomp could fairly get started into different keys
and different tunes, off went Barney into still different
tunes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made Frank and Reynard laugh at the coon, and they
heard him swear, and twang and thump away wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>At times the air and accompaniment harmonized and
were timed alike, when suddenly Barney would flip from
fast to slow time, leaving the coon thumping away furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then when the darky played slowly off went the fiddle at
a tremendous rate, leaving him far behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It finally got the moke so wild that he quit playing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day passed by uneventfully, and night fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Reynard had learned how to manage the Pegasus
and stood at the wheel, steering, about eight o’clock, when
suddenly he descried several twinkling lights ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Vessel ahead!” he shouted out the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you make her out to be?” cried Frank, running
in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! how can I make out in this gloom?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll direct the searchlight upon her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very dark down below, but through the gloom
Frank plainly saw the twinkling lights on the moving vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned the searchlight by means of a lever, so that it
was directed toward the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he switched on the electric current.</p>

<p class='c000'>A broad shaft of light suddenly swept down upon the
vessel, lighting her up as if by a big beam of sunlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a steamship.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell of surprise arose from her crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were alarmed and amazed at the brilliant, dazzling
glow suddenly shooting down upon them from the sky, and
the most marvelous ideas of its origin entered their minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank leveled a glass at the craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the Red Star!” he exclaimed. “I see the name
on her bow!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” yelled the detective, delightedly. “Now we’ll
get Murdock!” and down swooped the air engine toward
the speeding steamer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>FOUND AND LOST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Steamer ahoy!” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy! What’s that?” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This? An airship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By thunder, I thought it was a comet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish to board you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall we haul to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. Hold this ladder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank dropped a rope ladder down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two sailors seized it and held it rigid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had the wheel, and kept the Pegasus over the
steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective and Frank descended the ladder to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they were met by the captain, the watch on deck
and many of the cabin passengers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is an amazing call,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are here on business, sir,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“That is very strange.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not at all. We have come from Readestown.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! Can it be possible! What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To make a prisoner of one of your passengers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am more and more astonished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man is a murderer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A murmur of surprise ran from lip to lip at this remark.
When the captain recovered from the shock he asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the man’s name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Martin Murdock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whom did he murder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“His stepson, a boy named Joe Crosby.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why was the crime committed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So Murdock could inherit the boy’s fortune.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Purser, have we a man of that name aboard?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir,” the purser replied, in positive tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps he has taken a fictitious name,” hinted Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True. He had ample reason to,” admitted the captain.
“Try to describe him. We might recognize him that way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is forty, very dark, has a black mustache, and a vivid
V-shaped scar on his left cheek,” said the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, that’s Mr. Blank, who occupies stateroom No. 22.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Produce him and we will try to identify him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, if you have a warrant for his arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here it is,” said the detective, exhibiting the paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The purser went off in search of Mr. Blank.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ten minutes he returned empty handed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The individual in question had vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one now started off in search of him, and he was
finally discovered hiding in one of the coal bunkers below.</p>

<p class='c000'>He presented a very dirty and ruffled appearance when
they hauled him up on deck, struggling and swearing furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the detective saw him he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure?” asked the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d swear to it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take him—he ain’t wanted here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, sir. Now, then, Murdock——”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rascal recognized the officer and saw the handcuffs
Tom had drawn from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shuddered at the sight of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spare me!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir! You are my prisoner!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t put those things on me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you submit peacefully?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, yes! I’ll do anything you order.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Climb up that ladder to the airship!” exclaimed the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” said Murdock, and up he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Reynard followed him, and the ship sped on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp received the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ yo’ gwine ter do wif him?” he asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lock him up in the storeroom downstairs. He can’t
very well escape with Pegasus up in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ shuah, sah!” assented the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take him down, Pomp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes sah!” and off the darky marched the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our work is almost done now, Reynard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m glad we succeeded so easily.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hey, Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Turn the Pegasus around and steer for home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, it’s the great man-hunters we bees,” said the
Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship mounted the clouds and retraced her course.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was jubilant over their success.</p>

<p class='c000'>They discussed the capture until bedtime, and finally
turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney remained on duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>About ten o’clock the inventor suddenly said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going down to have a talk with the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, it’s bad company you’ll be kapin’, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish to learn the facts about Joe Crosby.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ther facts, is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—what Murdock did with his victim’s body.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, an’ he’ll not tell yer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll try him, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank passed down below as he said this and made his
way to the storeroom.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the door broken open.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going in he saw that the prisoner was not there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very much startled Frank searched all over for the man,
but soon discovered that he was not aboard the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>A long drag-rope hung down from the side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its end almost trailed in the sea, as the engine of the
clouds had been lowered to within a few hundred feet
of the ocean to get her out of a dense cloud bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the four life-preservers was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was clear that Martin Murdock had broken from the
room, took a life-preserver, went up on deck unseen, lowered
the drag-rope and slid down to the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, he calculated, safer to trust himself to the mercy
of the ocean than remain aboard the Pegasus, be carried
back to Chicago and have to answer to a charge of murder.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Seeing how matters stood, Frank returned to Barney
and explained what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, he’s as slippery as an eel!” groaned the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop the engine and retrace your course!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it a sarch fer him yez would have me make?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By all means. Drop her down near the sea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“May the aould Nick floy away wid there spalpeen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By an effective use of the searchlight we may find him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You kape watch, Masther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney lowered the engine and flashed the light down
on the sea, the surface of which he swept with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armed with a powerful glass Frank scanned the water
everywhere the light struck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although they searched and searched everywhere until
it was time to arouse the others to relieve them, they failed
to find any trace of the missing man.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Pomp and Reynard were aroused and told what
transpired, they were wild with vexation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” cried the coon, “I done lock him in de sto’room,
sah, an’ nebber tink ob sich a ting as dot he gwine fo’ ter
git out. Bress my soul, if I know dat he git away I’d aslep’
befo’ de do’ wif one eye open de hull night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve had all our trouble in vain,” sighed the detective,
dolefully. “Holy smoke! he’s a daisy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then Frank caught sight of a white object floating
in the water and he leveled the glass at it</p>

<p class='c000'>“A life-preserver!” he muttered. “And bless me if it
isn’t the very one Murdock stole from the storeroom. It’s
got the name Pegasus upon it. Lower the ship, Pomp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>She soon reached the surface of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took a boat hook and hoisted up the life-preserver.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hunt was made about the vicinity for the man, but they
did not find him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It occurred to them that he was drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>A ship was descried in the distance just then.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He may have been picked up by that vessel,” Frank
suggested. “Let’s run up to her and see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon steered for the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they arrived within a short distance of her they
saw by the searchlight that she was plunging into a fog
bank, and Frank viewed her with his glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a violent start a moment later.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ship May Queen, of Liverpool,” he read on her
stern, “and, by heavens, there’s Murdock standing on her
deck, surrounded by sailors watching us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried the detective. “Follow her, Pomp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sah!” the coon replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>He grasped the lever to increase the speed of the engine,
when a report pealed from the deck of the boat, and a shot
from her signal gun roared out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It struck the forward tube of the rotascope frame, there
sounded a crash as the upright broke, and the next moment
the helices all stopped, as the electric wire that gave current
to them was severed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down into the sea plunged the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of alarm escaped her crew when they felt her falling,
and the next moment the ship dissolved from view into
the thick fog bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down rushed the Pegasus like a meteor.</p>

<p class='c000'>She struck the sea with a violent thud.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shower of brine flew up over her, and the next moment
she disappeared from view under the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship thus escaped, bearing Murdock away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>FOILED AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Pegasus rose to the surface at once and floated like
any ship, but she had taken in considerable water and was
badly crippled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank heard a mocking laugh come from amid the fog
in the voice of Martin Murdock, as the ship receded.</p>

<p class='c000'>It filled the inventor with wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may escape now!” he shouted, “but I’ll catch you
if I have to chase you around the world, Martin Murdock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fool! You can never catch me!” came the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voice was so indistinct that Frank realized how useless
it would be to protract a conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Man the pump, Barney!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor!” replied the Celt</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pomp, help me to clear the wreckage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de Lawd! am de hull ting busted?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we may be able to repair it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went up on the turret, and, assisted by Reynard,
they took down the broken parts, while Barney was busy
pumping out the water the engine shipped.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible to do anything in the gloom.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the vessel floated buoyantly, they put her water-screw
in motion to give her steerageway, and started off.</p>

<p class='c000'>She proceeded so slowly in the water, though, that they
had no hope of overtaking the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, the fog was so dense they could not see it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Barney and Frank turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sea was calm enough and the wind moderate, so
they passed a quiet night and met with no accidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning they set to work to repair the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>damage, and were kept busy all day and far into the succeeding
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>As there were plenty tools and materials on board, they
finally succeeded in repairing the damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work was so well done that it would have been very
difficult to tell that the machine was broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can ascend now,” said Frank. “But whether we
will overtake that ship or not is an open question.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She was heading eastward, wasn’t she?” questioned Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely bound for Liverpool, as she came from
there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What could have induced her crew to shoot at us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdock probably incited them to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be ther hokey, he’s a vilyun!” growled Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Send her up,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pulling the helix lever the Celt caused them to revolve,
and the engine rose from the sea, dripping water, and
mounted up in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank carefully watched the spinning wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could not see any defect in their action, and soon felt
confident that they would continue to operate properly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up, up the Pegasus soared like a bird on the wing until
she reached the lowest strata of clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she plunged into them the sea was obscured.</p>

<p class='c000'>She rose above them presently and paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a glorious scene was observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silvery moonlight streamed down unobstructed upon
the sea of clouds beneath the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had a billowy appearance, their constant movement
lending them a strange aspect as the lights and shadows
changed from moment to moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>A soft, dark, velvety gloom filled the vault of Heaven,
which was only broken by the vivid points of light emanating
from the stars that studded the firmament.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a silent region.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air was very rare and exhilarating.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having stopped the ascent, Barney started the huge driving
wheels revolving, and drove the Pegasus ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked like silver as the moonlight slanted upon her
white metal hull, and to any one on the ocean must have
presented a strange, ghostly look with her electric lamps
glowing and her searchlight blazing out far ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>All night long she swept along through the dizzy height,
and in the morning her dazzling lights went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a sail was in view below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was discouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thought they would overtake the May Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You ought not feel down-hearted over it,” said the detective,
consolingly, although he felt disgusted himself.
“She may have changed her course so that we might have
passed her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose we head for Liverpool. We can find out all
about her there and wait for her to come in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s a very sensible plan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A rattling sound overhead reached Frank’s car at this
moment, and he glanced up at the big stern helix.</p>

<p class='c000'>A bolt at the top of the post had worked itself loose.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments it might fly off and injure the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>He hastened below, procured a long-handled wrench and
went up the frame to tighten the bolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting on top of the upper longitudinal girder he reached
over the revolving helix and began to tighten the bolt with
the long-handled wrench alluded to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely had this been done when the rim of the helix
caught his jacket as he carelessly leaned too close to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wheel was making rapid revolutions with enormous
power, and the next moment tore Frank from his foothold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Held by the jacket he was whirled around and around
furiously by the big wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of consternation escaped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any moment he was liable to be hurled off into space.</p>

<p class='c000'>His cry was taken up by the rest when they saw the peril
of his position.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the helices were stopped to let him down the entire
ship would fall like a stone into the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank grasped the braces to sustain himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was getting frightfully dizzy from the swift gyrations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus was then floating at a height of 3,000 feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Barney observed what happened he immediately
slackened the speed of the helices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying machine began to descend swiftly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slower and slower whirled the wheels, until the engine
of the clouds was falling at the rate of 500 feet a minute.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s brain was in a whirl.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed every instant as if he would lose his senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a thing would be fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the wheel was going much slower, its velocity
was yet simply frightful.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made the inventor sick at his stomach and sent the
blood flying through his veins like fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>His sight failed him and a roaring noise sounded in his
ears, his body became cold and numb, and he could scarcely
breathe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly his fingers relaxed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was hurled far out from the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>His body shot through the air like a cannon ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment more he struck the water and sank.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Fortunately he was close to the water, and the sudden
shock of sinking revived his faculties again.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sank, and then rose to the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first he only knew enough to swim, but as his senses
gradually returned he finally realized his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing around he saw the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had settled into the water close by, and the screw
having been put in motion she glided toward him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp flung him a rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cotch dat!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heave away!” cheerily answered Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am yo’ orright, honey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Only a little dizzy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment more he was on the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>His coat was torn where the rim of the helix caught it,
and he was drenched, but that was all.</p>

<p class='c000'>While his friends raised the engine in the air he went
inside again, put on dry clothing, and took a drink of
brandy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus reached the coast of Ireland and went over
to Liverpool where she alighted on the suburbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her descent drew a large crowd of people to the spot,
but they finally landed her in a private garden at the offer
of the owner, where she was kept secluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then went to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, by dint of inquiry, he learned that the May Queen
was coming into the harbor at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Delighted to hear this, Frank hired a tug and went out
to meet the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going aboard of her he asked the captain, sternly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where’s the man you picked up at sea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Martin Murdock? We met a French steamer and he
left us to go aboard of her. She was bound for Havre.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Foiled again!” cried Frank, in disgust.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did you want of him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a murderer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good Lord! Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you fire at the airship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It frightened us. We did not know what it was until
too late. Then we were so scared we fled.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did Murdock pay you for your help?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, very handsomely, too; but had we known that he
was a fugitive from the law we would have imprisoned him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then returned to the tug.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat was sent flying back to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he made haste to get back to the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Telling his friends what happened, he added:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Up in the air with her! We must go to Havre after
him. Quick, boys, quick!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>SAVED FROM DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The airship soared up to the clouds and sped away over
Great Britain toward the English Channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tremendous shout arose from the populace who had
seen her ascent, and hearing the shouting, Frank thought it
was a token of their approval of the engine’s work.</p>

<p class='c000'>He strode to the rail and doffed his cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the shout pealed out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked perplexed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not sound like a cheer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he heard a faint cry below.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Help! Help!” was the scream.</p>

<p class='c000'>It sounded like the voice of a boy, and the inventor glanced
down, when, to his amazement, he observed a lad of about
fifteen hanging to the drag rope by his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been among the spectators.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the rope swept by he thought it would be great fun to
seize it and let the airship lift him up a short distance, when
he calculated to let go and drop to the ground again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately the aerostat lifted him up so high before
he could carry out the latter part of his resolve, that he
found he would very likely kill himself if he relaxed his grip
on the rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank realized at a glance what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello, there!” he shouted down at the youngster.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Save me!” screamed the boy, in terrified tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t let go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can’t hold on long. My strength is going!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens!” muttered Frank, in startled tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that only the quickest kind of work would prevent
the little fellow from perishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was his peril that caused the crowd to shout.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Help, Barney!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing at the end of the drag rope he saw that it was
securely fastened to a ring bolt in the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without losing another moment he grasped the rope,
swung himself off the deck and rapidly slid down to the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurry—hurry!” the little fellow was groaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hang on a moment more!” shouted Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along he slid, so fast that the rope burned the palms of
his hands, until he reached the youngster.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he reached down and seized him by the collar.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had he done so when the poor boy’s strength
suddenly gave out and he let go the rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>His hands fell to his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank bore all his weight with one hand, for with the
other he was obliged to sustain himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>He was very powerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still the strain on his muscles was immense.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had heard his cry, and rushing to the side he
looked over and saw how the situation stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brace up!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh I’m so dizzy!” groaned the frightened boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll get over it in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll fall—I know I shall!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, you won’t. I’ve got you fast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy groaned, for he was in a panic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The strain on Frank’s arm began to tell on him, for the
rope was swaying, like the pendulum of a clock, in the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was so accustomed to great heights that it did not
affect him in the least.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the inexperienced boy felt awful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Masther Frank!” yelled Barney. “What’ll I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lower the engine as fast as you can!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney rushed to the turret to comply, and a moment
later they were flying earthward at an alarming rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy cried and gasped for breath, and Frank tightened
his fingers on his collar and clung to the rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their combined weight at such a great distance from the
deck of the Pegasus was so great that it would have been
a difficult task for Reynard, Barney and Pomp to haul
them up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down they shot toward the woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was clear that they would plunge into it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out now!” shouted Frank, in warning tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have me oye on the threes!” returned Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must leave him here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In a three?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll grade her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a minute more they reached the topmost branches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank watched for a favorable opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you get home from here?” he asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—yes—anywhere!” panted the little fellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have to leave you in a tree.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can get to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here’s the one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus had drifted to a tall tree with thick upper
branches against which they struck.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the boy grasped a branch Frank let him go.</p>

<p class='c000'>He clung safely to the branch a moment, and then quickly
made his way down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ultimately he got home in safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sighed with relief and straightened up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Winding the rope around one leg he rested himself and
then went up, hand over hand, until he reached the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here his three companions met him with:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How in thunder did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar de kid come from, honey?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, it wor dead I thought yez was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few words Frank detailed the circumstance and they
returned to the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Reynard resumed the management of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine returned to the clouds and they finally reached
the English channel and crossed over to Havre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a descent was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a thought flashed across Frank’s mind that brought
a cry of bitter disappointment from his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, what’s the trouble?” asked Reynard, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In my haste I forgot to ask the captain of the ship the
name of the steamer Murdock went on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! That’s a daisy mistake!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now we’ll have trouble, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely. All that will save us will be inquires.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They brought the engine to the ground in the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was long after midnight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could then be done, so they turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following morning Frank proceeded to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a good linguist and made inquiries at the Custom
House about the incoming steamers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three were expected that day, he learned, and none had
come in the day previous.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was therefore very fair to presume that the fugitive
was on one of the several that were expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>His next move was to apprise the prefect of police that
there was an American murderer on board of one of the
vessels expected, and ask his aid to secure the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The request was granted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Officers armed with warrants and a description of the
man were posted to wait for Murdock, with Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire day thus passed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the morning one of the vessels came in and in the
afternoon another, but Murdock was not on either of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was late in the night when the third ship made the
port, and feeling sure that his man was aboard, Frank and
the officers went out and boarded her.</p>

<p class='c000'>A search was made among the passengers, but he was
not found among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then spoke to the captain, asking him:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you take a man from a ship off the British coast?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” replied the captain. “He was an American.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Left the vessel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. He paid to be set ashore at Cherbourg.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Did he say where he was going?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a word.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank returned to his friends and told them the news.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very exasperating, but the detective said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s cross the bay of the Seine and inquire about him.
We may get on his trail yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan was carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short time afterwards the aerostat landed near the
city, and Frank left her again.</p>

<p class='c000'>He soon came hastening back, his face aglow with pleasure,
and cried, as he got aboard:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ve discovered what became of him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is he?” eagerly asked the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the rail. He purchased a compartment on a train
which will carry him to Marseilles, in the south of France.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! Has he been gone long?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Five hours ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be hard to tell which train it is if we met it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true; but I know when it is due at its destination
to-morrow, and we have only to go ahead, and as we can
easily pass him we will get there ahead of the cars. When
the train arrives we’ll be waiting for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He may trick us again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps, but he don’t know we are after him, and therefore
will not look for us,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus started off again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>BAFFLED AGAIN AND AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The engine of the clouds reached Marseilles five hours
ahead of the train on which Martin Murdock was riding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank knew what time the cars were due.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Cherbourg he had met a Custom House inspector who
saw the man land from the steamer, and purchase his railroad
ticket for the south of France.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus was landed late in the afternoon, and the
young inventor went to the railroad depot.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the train came in he saw Murdock alight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming up behind the man and clapping a hand on his
shoulder, Frank exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Martin Murdock, you are my prisoner!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blast it, the inventor!” gasped the man, in startled
tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned around, glared at Frank a moment and then
clapped his hand to his hip-pocket to draw a revolver.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor was as quick as he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment they were aiming at each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shout of alarm escaped the people around, and they
scattered in all directions, fearful of being shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deep silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must submit!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!” determinedly replied Murdock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am bound to take you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not while I can resist, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without the least warning Murdock fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet grazed Frank’s head and he staggered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock dashed out into the street and ran away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Recovering himself, Frank rushed after him, but the villain
jumped into a carriage and was whirled away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vehicle went toward the water front.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank ran along after it, holding a handkerchief to his
head where a wound had been inflicted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The carriage soon distanced him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He afterwards met it coming back and hailed the driver.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does monsieur wish to ride?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. Here’s a five-dollar piece.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Monsieur is very generous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can have it if you carry me to where you just took
the man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly. Step into the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did so, and was whirled away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The driver took him to a pier.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he paused, and as Frank alighted, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Monsieur, here is where I carried my last fare.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He boarded a North German Lloyd steamer which was
just getting ready to put out to sea, bound for Alexandria.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was fairly stunned.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was marvelous how the fugitive escaped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was certainly the slipperiest customer Frank ever met.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed as if he were pursued by the most extraordinary
good luck in all his ventures to escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Telling the driver to take him back to where he had left
the Pegasus, the inventor asked if he knew the name of the
steamer, and the cabman replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was the Khedive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He then drove Frank away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rejoining his companions, Frank told them the news.</p>

<p class='c000'>It made them wild.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the detective said, consolingly:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“If he’s on that steamer we’ll soon overtake him. He
can’t dodge us there as he could on land.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“True,” assented Frank. “Let us follow him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was just about to go aboard when a number of gendarmes
came running up to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was surrounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are my prisoner, sir!” said one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean by that?” asked Frank, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were dueling with a man at the railroad depot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no! He was a criminal whom I strove to capture.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I care not what he was; you are under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was intensely annoyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it could not be helped.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he had to submit.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried to explain to the prefect, but that dignitary
was a very crabbed old martinet, and locked him up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was kept in durance vile for several days, and his
friends had to produce proof by telegraph from Havre that
the chief of police there sanctioned Frank’s work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inventor was then reluctantly released from custody.</p>

<p class='c000'>His friends bore him off in triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lost no time getting aboard the Pegasus and sending
her up into the air after that.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she sped away over the beautiful blue sea Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems as if fate were against us. We have lost three
days. It will be impossible to reach Alexandria, in time to
beat the steamer. I’m afraid Murdock has got the best of
us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! you ought to be glad you got out!” said
the detective. “I was afraid you’d go to prison. Don’t complain.
We must make the best of the bad situation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra,” said Barney, “it’s a long chase he do be afther
givin’ us, an’ me a-thinkin’ that we’d only have ter catch
ther spalpeen on ther say whin he tuck ther forst shtaimer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine ter run us all de way roun’ de worl’!” growled
Pomp, angrily. “Spec we won’t cotch him eben den.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all provoked, surprised and nettled over the
persistence with which the rascal eluded them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several days passed by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus crossed Italy and Turkey, and going over
the Mediterranean in the night the Pharos was sighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flying machine sank down over the ships in the harbor,
and the searchlight flashed down upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the crews were frightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank carefully examined every one of the ships until
he found the one he wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the Khedive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over her the airship paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she sank until she was close beside the steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney did not let her sink into the water, but held her
so that the two decks were flush with each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the watch on the German steamer’s deck had seen the
airship come down.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now crowded to the side, and, staring at her in
amazement, they began asking questions about her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank satisfied their curiosity, and then asked them:</p>

<p class='c000'>“When did your ship come in?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yesterday,” was the reply of the mate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you have a passenger named Murdock from Marseilles?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We wish to see him on business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Describe the man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did so.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he finished the mate said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We did have such a man aboard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Boarded you without baggage just as you left port?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that’s the man, but he has gone, of course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know where?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Jerusalem, in a boat for Jaffa.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Positive, for our captain went with him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank questioned the mate at some length further, and
having thanked him for his information, he saw that a
large number of boats were approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crews were curious about the strange airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Foreseeing that he would be pestered by them, Frank
went into the pilot-house and raised the engine 500 feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>She then sped away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We know where the villain has gone, at any rate,” said
Frank, grimly. “By to-morrow we will reach the Dead Sea
in Palestine, and meet the beggar in the Holy Land.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He probably imagines he has escaped us now,” said the
detective, “although he must know that we mean to dog
him if we have to go all around the world to catch him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine glided smoothly along, and reaching the land
she headed for the Jordan River.</p>

<p class='c000'>By daybreak she reached Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hovering over the ancient city she excited the wonder of
the entire population who rushed from the houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were a strange mixture of Turks, Arabs and Egyptians
and looked upon the Pegasus as something supernatural.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship sank down until she hovered over the house
tops, and Frank went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a square below he observed several white men dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>like himself, and among them a stout German in the blue
uniform and brass buttons of a ship captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Frank’s glance rested upon this man he came
to the conclusion that he was the captain of the Khedive.</p>

<p class='c000'>To assure himself, he shouted, in German:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hey, captain, we have just come from your steamer at
Alexandria!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t say so!” replied the other, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he began asking the usual questions about the Pegasus,
her object and so forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man we want is with you!” said the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no,” replied the captain. “He was with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Left him last night with a caravan bound for Bagdad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thwarted again, by thunder!” cried Frank, in disgust.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE OASIS IN THE DESERT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was broiling hot when the engine of the clouds flew
over the Syrian Desert toward the Dehanah Mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was scarcely a breath of air stirring, there came a
dreadful glare from the sand, and a deep silence prevailed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp sent the machine high in the sky to avoid the
smothering heat radiated by the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest were at breakfast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far in the distance stood an oasis in the desert.</p>

<p class='c000'>It consisted of a few rocks around a wady, or reservoir of
spring water, several gaunt palms, a little grass, and a
small number of dark green bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The caravans of mules and camels usually march at
night to avoid the heat, and rest by day in these oases, if
any are found.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp knew this.</p>

<p class='c000'>He therefore concluded that the caravan they sought for
might be there, and steered the Pegasus toward it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the machine drew nearer to it he caught sight of several
white tents pitched among the trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>There now remained no doubt in his mind about the place
being an encampment of the natives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, a few moments afterwards he discerned the figures
of several camels lying on the ground in the shade.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a speaking-tube in the room, and Pomp grasped
it and shouted in the mouthpiece:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All han’s on deck!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s the matter?” Frank answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dar am a camp ahead ob us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was enough for the inventor. He came running
out, followed by the others, and went up forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>He quickly saw the oasis and its occupants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely the very caravan we are in search of,” he
told his friends. “Pomp, lower the Pegasus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In de oasis?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. We’ll take them by surprise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine settled down, but before she could reach the
ground the cries of the camels brought the natives from
their huts, and they saw the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>A scene of excitement ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wildest cries escaped the natives, and they prostrated
themselves upon the ground, touching the earth with their
foreheads.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of them looked like Arabs.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were seven in the party, and every one men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frightened by the air engine, the camels got upon their
feet and plunged about the oasis in the wildest manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank keenly eyed the Arabs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All natives,” he commented.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mayn’t Murdock be in a tint?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I doubt it, but I’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you speak to them?” asked Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not in their tongue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then the airship alighted on four flanges and stood
on the ground perfectly rigid near the Arabs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank alighted with Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Going over to the three tents he peered in.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He isn’t here!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps he is in another caravan,” suggested the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“More than likely, for he isn’t in the oasis or we’d see
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let’s go ahead, then. These poor wretches are badly
scared.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” assented Frank, and they returned aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus was sent skyward.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she had risen the seven men arose.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of them burst out laughing and muttered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a narrow escape! But they failed to penetrate my
disguise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was Murdock!</p>

<p class='c000'>For safety against the natives he had put on this disguise
when he started to cross the desert with his six paid servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>It now stood him in good stead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ignorant of the deception that had been practiced upon
them the crew of the air engine arose to a height of 430 feet
and the coon sent the machine ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank watched the people in the oasis with a glass, and
as they vanished astern in the distance he said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I was almost sure Murdock was among them. However,
we must look further. It was disappointing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwine straight ahead ter Bagdad?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. We can run across him long before he reaches
there. The caravans travel very slowly, going at a walk,
while we can get along at the rate of a mile a minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was now posted on watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of the journey was finished by the afternoon,
but not another caravan was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was surprised at this.</p>

<p class='c000'>It began to dawn upon Frank’s mind that an error had
been made somewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could it be possible that the captain of the steamer
sent us on a wild goose chase?” he asked the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, it looks as if we’d been fooled!” replied Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would have been impossible for any caravan to have
reached this place ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yer roight there, sor. Now, them spalpeens in the
oasis——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you suspicious about them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, it shtruck me as Murdock might be wid ‘em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How could he have escaped detection?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be makin’ himself luck loike ther resht av ther gang.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you see anny av their mugs?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, for they kept their faces to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that’s where yer mishtake waz.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank began to agree with this idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been careless by trusting too much to outward
appearances, and now deeply regretted it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m going back to meet that caravan!” said he, finally.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Moight jest as well wait here, as they’re bound ter come
along.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. There’s a good place to wait.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He pointed out a rocky gorge, and the engine descended.</p>

<p class='c000'>All travelers to Bagdad had to pass through it.</p>

<p class='c000'>They remained there until the following day, when the
coon descried some camels approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an hour the caravan reached them, and our friends saw
that they were the very men they wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were only four in the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each man rode a camel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they drew near the airship Frank and his friends,
armed with rifles, confronted them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Halt!” cried the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Arabs gave a shout of fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one glance they recognized the adventurers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the camels were stopped and one of them yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“No shoot—no shoot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The rascal speaks English!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Me not got money!” continued the Arab.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He takes us for bandits!” laughed the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take camel; no kill us!” continued the native.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dismount!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes! yes!” cried the man, as he and his friends obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are your friends?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Free—gone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The white man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, he gone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was an acknowledgment that there was a white man
among them, as Barney had surmised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was quick to notice it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He therefore asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did the white man dress like you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Fraid of de Bedouins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know his name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Martin, he say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Martin, eh? He had a cut face, didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One mark on de cheek dis shape,” said the Arab, stretching
open his first and second finger in a V-shape.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the man. Where has he gone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Samara, on de Euphrates water near de ruins of
Babylon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who did he have with him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two of de mens. He ‘fraid to come to Bagdad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How came you to be with him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He pay. Me interpreter an’ guide to Jerusalem.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah—I see. Now, where does he intend to go?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Down de river to de Persian gulf.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you are lying to me I will come back and kill you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no! Me tell trufe!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man was so frightened that he really spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank then allowed them to pass, and going aboard the
Pegasus with his friends they started her up.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now had evidence enough of the cunning of the
man they were chasing, for he gave them the slip at every
turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He seems to anticipate every move we make,” said
Frank, in thoughtful tones. “Now he will make better time
on the water. As we don’t know what boat he is in, and
there may be scores of them on the river, it will be like
hunting for a needle in a haystack to find him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus ran to the southward.</p>

<p class='c000'>She finally reached the big river.</p>

<p class='c000'>There they lowered her to within a short distance of the
surface of the water, and caused her to follow the course
of the stream toward the gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>She sped along, and a keen lookout was maintained for
boats going down the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward midnight a vessel was seen in advance, and the
Pegasus bore down upon it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>BUYING A SHIP’S CREW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>As the airship drew near the boat, a number of Persians
were seen swarming over her deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus had created a profound sensation among
them for they were wildly gesticulating, loudly talking, and
all at once began to discharge a number of rifles at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hail of bullets struck her.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the leaden pellets hummed over her deck Frank and
his companions rushed inside and closed the windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>They headed their boats for the city of Bassorah, a short
distance down the stream, and kept up a steady fire at the
Pegasus as they retreated before her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discharge of firearms alarmed the people in the city,
and in a few moments the bank of the river was thronged
with armed men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of them embarked in boats and put out to join the
one after which the Pegasus was going.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that there would be serious trouble if the engine
remained where she was, Frank raised her.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tremendous shout arose from the Persians when they
saw her fly up into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of them hastened back to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can’t do anything here!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howly floy!” roared Barney. “Is it roonin’ away yez
are? Be heavens, it’s as foine a ruction as iver I see yer
chaitin’ me out of, d’yer moind!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s no sense in fighting without an object in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, is it no object ter break their heads av thim
fellies?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think our man was on that boat?” asked Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. If he had been we would have seen him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, what a sensation dis yere airship make wif dem
yaller face niggahs!” chuckled Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having risen to an altitude of five hundred feet, the
engine plunged into a bank of fleecy white clouds, and the
scene below vanished from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank kept the Pegasus aloft until they had passed the
city, and then sent her down again.</p>

<p class='c000'>She ran down to the gulf without meeting another boat,
but out on the broad sheet of water they descried a number
of ships and steamers going in different directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank viewed them with a telescope.</p>

<p class='c000'>As his glance roved over the water he suddenly caught
sight of a moving figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riveting his attention intently upon it he suddenly cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“By thunder, there’s a man in the water!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whar?” gasped Pomp, in startled tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Astern of that steamer to the southeast.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surah ‘nough! It am a man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, steer for that steamer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will that!” and off went the engine on another tack.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she drew close to the man she paused, and they
saw that he was almost naked and clung to a broken plank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down settled the Pegasus, and when she drew near the
surface of the water Frank shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A voice!” cried the man in the water, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Catch this rope and come aboard!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank God, I’m saved!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank dropped a rope ladder down.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it fell near the man he grasped it eagerly and began
to ascend to the deck of the engine of the clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was assisted aboard by the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man was evidently an American.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wore only a pair of pants.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a smooth face, brown hair, sunburned skin, and
was evidently about forty years of age.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord, ain’t I glad!” he cried, delightedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you get into the water?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A man flung me overboard from my ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An attempted murder, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s just about the size of it, sir. But say, what is
this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank explained about the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he said, questioningly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What vessel are you from?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That steamer ahead, there—the Rover.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You haven’t been long in the water, then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no. Only half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did the man try to kill you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll explain. My ship is a San Francisco trader. Her
last stop was in the Euphrates. She was homeward bound
to-night when a native boat came up behind her. I stood
on deck, aft. The first thing I knew a fellow, looking like
an Arab, came up a rope at the stern, from the Persian
boat. He gave me a thump that knocked me senseless.
When I revived I saw that the man was a white man in
disguise. He had on my clothes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha! Did he look like this?” interposed Frank, quickly,
and he gave the sailor a description of Murdock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that’s a life-like picture of him!” said the man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Well, before I could say a word to him he flung me overboard.
The native boat had vanished. By good luck I
had my senses and swam. A piece of plank was drifting
near me and I seized it. The steamer went on. I yelled
for help, but no one seemed to hear me. I was left to my
fate until you just found me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So Martin Murdock is on that steamer, eh? Well, by all
that’s wonderful this is a good piece of news! I never expected
to find him so easily.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You seem to know the man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Listen and I’ll tell you his history.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank related all that had transpired.</p>

<p class='c000'>It surprised the sailor.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the inventor finished, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t it queer that you should find me and get on his
track again?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very,” assented Frank. “Now, I’ve got a plan to
propose to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” queried the sailor, curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll put you back aboard the Rover. You can tell your
captain what happened. They will arrest the man. Then
we will take charge of him. Will you do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gladly. I want to get even with him, badly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. Say, Barney, overhaul the steamer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All the rest had overheard the sailor’s story, and the
Celt steered the engine after the steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to tell you something,” said the rescued man, as
they flew along in pursuit of the distant vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The captain and crew of the Rover are a bad set.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If that fellow has got plenty money and offers to bribe
them to protect him, they will do so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s bad! Why do you think he attacked you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably to get my clothes for a disguise. But he will
find it won’t work, as he can’t palm himself off for me. Besides,
I must admit that I gave him a little fight before he
got the best of me, and his murderous attempt to take my
life might have come from a fit of revenge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s more than likely it, as he is very spiteful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine was flying along swiftly and soon came up
with the big steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank left the rope ladder hanging down, and as the Pegasus
paused above the steamer the sailor went down and
landed on the vessel’s deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The watch had seen the airship, and their shouts aroused
the people down below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was on deck when the sailor came down from
the Pegasus and instantly surrounded him.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as they heard his story several of them ran off in
search of Martin Murdock.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they found him he was in company with the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stand back, there!” the skipper cried to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Silence. See here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Money!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—one hundred dollars for every man who stands by
him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That settles it. He remains unharmed, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You bet he will! Tell the rest of the crew.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The men hastened away to comply.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes all the crew were apprised of the news,
and the man Frank saved felt disgusted over the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>Matters had terminated just as he feared, but he could
not do anything, unaided, to help the aeronauts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock was exultant.</p>

<p class='c000'>He discreetly remained below out of Frank’s sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor became impatient when he found
that nothing was done to produce the rascal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” he shouted down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want?” yelled the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man we sent for.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t have him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! Are you befriending him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aye, aye! with our blood, if necessary!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This answer startled Frank, for it gave him plainly to
understand that Murdock had won the friendship of the
ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will blow your craft to pieces with bombs!” he
shouted, angrily. “You will repent of your folly, captain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bosh! We are armed and do not fear you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank withdrew from the rail and started for the deck-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had scarcely reached the door, however, when there
sounded a report like a pistol shot down in the hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment the helices began to slacken speed and
the Pegasus plunged down toward the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that some serious accident had happened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>IN A TIGER’S JAWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By the time the Pegasus dropped into the Persian Gulf
the helices had stopped revolving and the lights went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report Frank heard in the hold clearly indicated that
some accident happened that paralyzed all the mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rushed into the deck-house and hastened down below.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The engine of the clouds floated buoyantly, but the
steamer ran away from her rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rover was making fifteen knots an hour, and her
crew gave a yell of delight when they realized that some
accident had befallen the airship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now they expected to run away from the aerostat, and
carry Martin Murdock to San Francisco without molestation.</p>

<p class='c000'>That would be an easy way to earn the money he offered
them to protect him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes the steamer was far away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank lit a match in the hold and soon found that the
dynamo wheel had burst.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its fragments littered the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the power of the Pegasus was paralyzed.</p>

<p class='c000'>She could not move until the wheel was repaired, and as
Frank saw that it would occupy considerable time to do the
work he foresaw the escape of the trading steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then nine o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Reynard came running in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! what a daisy accident!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They will escape us now,” said Frank, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never saw the beat of the way Murdock slips away
from us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It can’t be helped. The best thing we can do is to get
to work and repair the damage at once. The sooner we fix
the wheel the quicker we can pursue the steamer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were called down.</p>

<p class='c000'>They worked like beavers all night long, and it was long
after daybreak before they had the wheel replaced by a
new one, and the machinery put in order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp prepared breakfast, after partaking of which they
took turns at sleeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank stood first watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised the Pegasus in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new dynamo wheel acted stiffly at first, but finally
got into good working order and the engine traveled properly
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Keeping a constant lookout for the steamer, the young
inventor ran the engine down to the Arabian Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney relieved him of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus was headed for Ceylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night fell upon the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing had been seen of the Rover yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made a calculation after supper while in the cabin,
and turning to the detective he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We ought to sight the steamer by this time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“According to the distance she traveled and that which
we have made, she must be somewhere in this vicinity, off
the coast of India.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Knowing that we are in pursuit of her the crew will
very likely to keep her concealed from us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just what I expect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we might pass her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m afraid of that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To lose her would be a serious matter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdock might take to the shore. In that case we
might never find him. I’m going ahead very slowly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you keeping the Pegasus so close to the sea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To avoid the possibility of missing the steamer if she’s
on the water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank arose and went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a clear, moonlit night, and every object below was
plainly visible for a long way off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were on duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a short distance rose the coast of India.</p>

<p class='c000'>Close under the lee Frank suddenly saw a dark, moving
object and riveting his attention upon it intently he shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, stop the Pegasus!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor,” replied the Celt, obeying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see a vessel without any lights.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faith, an’ that’s more than I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look close to the shore, there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A momentary silence followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Irishman saw the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned the airship toward it and as they drew closer
he suddenly directed the searchlight upon the craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of delight now escaped Frank, for he recognized
the steamer to be the Rover.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s her!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, they’ve hauled to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ain’t they lowering a boat, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are that, an’ rowin’ fer shore. Be ther powers,
there’s a man in ther boat wid thim sailors dhressed in
citizen’s clothes, who, I’ll take me oat’, must be Martin
Murdock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can they be carrying him ashore to escape us in the
jungles? It looks like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The quarter boat reached the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing through the surf, she was beached.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man alluded to sprang out and ran up on the sand,
while the sailors got their boat afloat again.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they rowed back to the steamer the man on the
shore stood in plain view, watching the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The searchlight was flashed upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was thus given to understand that he was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning around, he rushed away into the bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Frank observed his action.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There he goes!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that must be Murdock!” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Chase him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Away flew the engine toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quarter boat returned to the steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Pegasus reached a point near the vessel the
signal gun on the Rover was suddenly discharged at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been loaded with bullets, nails and pieces of lead,
and the scattering shot struck her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was too strong to suffer any injury from such small
shot, however, and continued on her way unhurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder if the man going ashore wasn’t a scheme to
draw us near so they could fire at us?” muttered Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Masther Frank!” yelled Barney, “is it wid a shmoile
yez will take thim shots, or shall we return thim wid our
compliments?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fire a volley at the rascals!” replied the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon, the Irishman and the detective obeyed this
order by discharging their rifles at the sailors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several mournful howls were returned, showing that the
bullets had hit their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing on, the Pegasus left the steamer astern and
reached the land where the fugitive vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had gone into a jungle.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was half a mile in diameter and surrounded by clear
ground upon all sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the fugitive were to attempt to escape from it the occupants
of the flying machine would not fail to see him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that it would be a difficult task to find the
man in the night, so he said to his friends:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am going to keep the Pegasus poised above the jungle
here until daybreak. In the meantime, if you will keep
watch he can’t get away without being seen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest agreed with this plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time the engine of the clouds floated but 200 feet
above the waving grass.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was kept there.</p>

<p class='c000'>A watch was posted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing occurred during the night to disturb our friends,
and when daylight finally came they aroused themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank went out on deck he heard a deep, low moan,
like the rumbling of falling earth, in the jungle below.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is by this plaintive sigh that the royal tiger makes
his presence known, and in company with other animals of
his species he caterwauls like a gigantic Tom cat.</p>

<p class='c000'>When charging, his spring is accompanied by a series of
rapid, frightful cough-like growls, and a single blow of his
paw will break the back of an ox which he carries away as a
cat carries off a mouse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had heard what terrible creatures the tigers of
India were, and was not surprised when he heard a man yell
furiously down in the jungle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a tiger after Murdock!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the jungle agitated off to the right, and watching
the spot closely he saw a man running.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the same individual whom he had observed the
night previously running into the cotton plants and boxwood
bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ran for a deep nullah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly behind him was a huge tiger in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild cry of horror escaped the poor wretch as he
glanced over his shoulder and saw the fiery-eyed monster
rapidly overtaking him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He fired a shot at the beast from his revolver, but before
he could do so again it sprang for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the air flew the graceful and beautiful body, and
in an instant more it struck the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was knocked down.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrible roar escaped the beast, as it landed on top of
him, and opened its foaming mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terrible jaws crunched the man’s bones, tore his
flesh and as a wild despairing cry escaped him the tiger
absolutely ripped him to pieces!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>LOSS OF A WHEEL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Frank had witnessed the terrible scene, and picking up a
rifle he aimed at the tiger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man had fallen into the nullah, and the brute was
then lying across the remains of his mangled body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that the unfortunate fellow had been killed, the
young inventor did not hesitate to discharge his pneumatic
rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The explosive bullet pierced the animal’s head.</p>

<p class='c000'>It burst there, blowing its skull to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the discharge the tiger bounded up into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>It landed ten feet away from its victim and rolled over,
dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one rushed to Frank’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have you shot?” asked the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A tiger. The beast just killed Martin Murdock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Howly Heaven!” gasped Barney. “Our man—dead?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Torn to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de Lawd!” gasped Pomp, in horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“See—there he lies on his face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Horrible! Horrible!” exclaimed Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faix, that inds our chase.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I’se glad de rascal am dead for killin’ dot po’ boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Send the Pegasus to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp did so, and Frank alighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He strode over to the tiger and saw that the animal’s head
had been shattered by the bomb-like bullet.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few steps more brought him to the brute’s victim.</p>

<p class='c000'>His body was frightfully mutilated, and Frank stooped
down and turned him over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Casting a glance at his face he staggered back.</p>

<p class='c000'>An exclamation of intense astonishment escaped him, and
seeing his three companions approaching he turned excitedly
toward them and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“This isn’t Murdock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It isn’t?” cried Reynard, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No. It’s the sailor we once rescued.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They all glanced at the man’s face and saw that Frank
had told the truth about his identity.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a while a deep silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they turned away from the sickening spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor fellow!” said Frank. “His fate was not deserved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ dey put him asho’ in dis yere suit fo’?” asked
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably to dupe us so they could get away,” said the
detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then,” added Barney, “whoile we’ve been a-waishtin’
their hull noight here, thim imps av Satan have been
sailin’ away from us as fasht as they could put, be heavens!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No doubt it was a stratagem upon their part to divert
us from them,” said Frank. “But what pretext they gave
the sailor for sending him ashore this way puzzles me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Warn’t he berry friendly ter us?” asked Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Grateful for saving his life. Maybe he showed the
captain how well disposed he was toward us. That would
have incited them against him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arrah, then it’s another chase we’ll be afther havin’
ter catch thim,” regretfully said Barney. “Shure, I
thought as the murdherer av little Joe Crosby had got his
deserts. An’ now, begob, he’s livin’ yet ter fool ther divil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must not waste time now,” said Frank. “Every
minute is precious. While we are talking here the Rover
is widening the breach between us. Let us go back to the
engine of the clouds and——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whirr-rr-rrr!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A familiar, buzzing sound interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It came from the direction of the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The machine is ascending!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He dashed forward at the top of his speed, and his companions
ran after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time Frank reached the engine she was ten feet
in the air, her helices flying around swiftly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible to touch her hull.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great Heaven! is she lost?” flashed across Frank’s mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrible thrill of dismay passed over him as he glanced
up at the ascending hull.</p>

<p class='c000'>But just then he caught sight of the drag rope, and he
rushed over to it and grasped it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment he was ascending to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>His friends were left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hastening up to the pilot-house Frank heard a terrific
noise inside and imagined that some man was in the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he hastened in he saw that it was caused by an enormous
orang-outang about four feet tall, of a brownish red
color, and having extremely long arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brute was evidently a denizen of the neighborhood,
and having gone aboard had began to play with the levers.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this means the helices were started.</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting one of its paws into the semi-circular handle of
one of the levers it could not withdraw it, and becoming
panic-stricken, it began to struggle to release itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It showed its huge canine teeth to Frank, threateningly,
as he entered, and uttered a fierce cry, while a most diabolical
look crossed its projecting face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens! An ape!” gasped the astonished inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brute renewed its fierce struggles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly tearing itself free, it came at Frank on all
four paws, and he retreated.</p>

<p class='c000'>With an agile bound the animal landed on top of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had no weapons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flinging up his hands he grasped the animal’s hairy
throat, but it used all its paws against him and began to
tear his clothes and scratch his skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>They fell to the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the struggle continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brute made a desperate effort to bite Frank, but
he succeeded in holding its ugly head back at arm’s length.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was wonderful the amount of energy, strength and
perseverance the beast exhibited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their struggles carried them near the edge of the deck,
and Frank suddenly arose, lifted the brute up, and exerting
all his strength he flung the animal away.</p>

<p class='c000'>It shot out through the air and plunged earthward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus was then nearly a thousand feet above the
earth, and the animal’s fall proved fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank Heaven, I’m rid of him!” panted Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt sore and exhausted.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he ran into the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Slackening the helices he sent the machine to the ground
again, and picked up his companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, it’s rainin’ moonkies!” cried Barney, as he
went aboard. “Masther Frank, it’s a quare place we’re in.
Shure, a villain av a wan dhropped from ther clouds an’
landed beside me, so near, faith, I though he’d a-hit me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I flung him from the Pegasus!” laughed the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then told his friends what happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>It astonished them considerably.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you hadn’t caught the drag,” said the detective, “the
ape would have sent the engine so high up in the air she
would never have come down again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They then started the Pegasus for the island of Ceylon,
and passing it, headed across the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>A lookout was maintained for the fugitive steamer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day passed away and as the sun was going down a
most serious accident occurred to the engine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank noticed a tremendous rattling sound at the end
of the driving wheel shaft.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made his way to the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he observed that the noise came from the smallest
of the two screws at the extreme end.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nut that held it on the shaft had worked loose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intending to stop the machinery and tighten the nut
Frank was just about to walk away to get a wrench when
there sounded a harsh, grating noise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wheel suddenly flew off the shaft.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spinning around and around it dropped down into the
sea into which it sank and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of vexation escaped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not have another wheel on board and had no
means of getting another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect was soon felt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine could now make no more than fifteen miles
an hour against the ordinary wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was crippled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her only reliance for speed was to go with a strong breeze
when she could add a few miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>All Frank’s friends rushed aft.</p>

<p class='c000'>They saw at once what had happened, and their expressions
of dismay were without number.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now how can we hope to overtake the Rover if we meet
her?” blandly asked Frank. “She can travel faster than
we can, under favorable conditions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bedad, she can’t bate us badly, anyhow,” said Barney.
“Should we see her it will be a case av nip an’ tuck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dar’s a sail now!” said Pomp, pointing northward.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a distant speck, miles away, near the coast, and
Frank passed into the turret to get a glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>He leveled it at the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s the Rover! I know her shape” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be heavens, I’ll folly her if I have ter shlape at ther
wheel!” said Barney. “We’ll niver lose thrack av her now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our only hope of capturing Murdock is to keep her in
view,” said Frank, grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It shall be done!” the detective declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Pomp was equally as determined about the matter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A BOMBSHELL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A week had passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>During all that time she had been steadily chasing the
steamship without gaining a mile on her in consequence of
the loss of one of her driving wheels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney remained on deck, bound to the railing; Pomp
was down in the engine-room, and Frank stood at the wheel
with Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Raise the Pegasus, quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great heaven, Reade, what is this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A cyclone. Look out for those rocks, Reynard!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know what the land is below us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The island of Borneo, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then that’s the China Sea to the northward.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. There! The steamer is lost in the gloom! We
may lose all trace of the Rover now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Zizz! came the wind in a wild shriek as the airship flew
upward into the dark vault of heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the great cliffs were dangerously close and as the
wind caught the engine it hurled her along with terrific
force and she struck the rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crash—bang!</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock was terrific.</p>

<p class='c000'>It shook her like an aspen.</p>

<p class='c000'>She glanced along the cliff, tore off huge particles, and
they went thundering down into the heavy seas that were
dashing up in foamy billows at the bases of the precipices
lining the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrible black pall surrounded the engine and obscured
everything so that the detective could not see a yard ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fierce wind was whirling in circles.</p>

<p class='c000'>It swept the Pegasus far over the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here her battle with the elements continued, and she
was dashed up and down and all around, furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along they were driven, and the coon suddenly yelled up
through a speaking-tube:</p>

<p class='c000'>“De oil engine jest broke heah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t we get any current?” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sah—no, sah! Slacken de helices, quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Frank jerked one of the levers over, and down they
settled toward the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>The searchlight had been started, but as the oil engine
now failed to operate the dynamo, the lights went out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was risky to descend in the gloom of that awful tempest,
not knowing where they were going to alight.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had to go down.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments a tremendous crashing was heard, the
engine swayed back and forth, and Barney roared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re goin’ among ther threes, bedad!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t stop her now!” replied Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, may ther saints presarve us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The crackling of branches continued as she went down,
and then there came a heavy shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had landed on her side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody was knocked down.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as they were assured that she was safely on the
ground they forgot their bumps and bruises, crept out, and
all hands left the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>They only had a lantern, but its dim light showed them
that they had fallen into a forest of ironwood, gutta percha,
camphor and other trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The marshes were alive with elephants and rhinoceros,
the woods swarmed with leopards, babyroussas and monkeys,
while bears roamed the rocky sections and buffaloes the
valleys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Birds of paradise, flamingoes, swallows that built edible
nests, peacocks and various other birds abounded in vast
numbers; every bird, beast and reptile filled with fear of
the storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their cries all around the fallen engine raised a fearful
din.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The hull and flying apparatus is intact,” said Frank,
when he had finished his inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think she is safe for the present?” the detective
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can’t get her out in this storm.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bettah turn in, den,” Pomp suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>An examination of the oil engine was made, when it was
found that the shaft of the flywheel had snapped in two.</p>

<p class='c000'>It could easily be repaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they turned in.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the following morning the storm had gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp prepared breakfast, but they had scarcely partaken
of it when the voices of men were heard outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Natives!” said Frank, listening to their talk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Savages?” asked the detective, quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Malays and Dyaks are the worst kind. They subsist
chiefly by hunting, fishing and piracy, are partly Mohammedans
and partly heathen, and are cruel, crafty and
wild,” said the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went out on deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing down he saw an army of the natives around the
engine, loudly talking and gesticulating toward her.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were Papus, yellowish colored, well-formed fellows,
carrying poisoned spears and arrows, and knotted clubs, with
which they beat out the brains of their prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>These people lived in the deepest woods and solitudes,
in caves and upon trees, naked, uncivilized and separate
from the rest of mankind.</p>

<p class='c000'>They knew nothing of the sultans, rajahs and penjerans
who governed the more civilized of the people of Borneo.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner had they seen Frank when a score of weapons
were sent flying at him, a single scratch from any of which
would have sufficed to poison him to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He quickly withdrew within the cabin and locked the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hostile, as I feared!” he commented.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hear them mounting the boat,” said Reynard, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. They will get into the turrets now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can’t we drive them away with our weapons?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, but it would amount simply to wanton slaughter,
as they have actually done us no harm yet, and cannot fight
us on a fair basis, protected as we are by these walls. I
have a plan to electrify the boat. See if you can turn the
dynamo flywheel a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While they were doing this Frank turned the current into
the deck of the engine, and a chorus of yells escaped the
natives as their bare feet received the current.</p>

<p class='c000'>It caused them to hastily leave the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime Frank and Barney procured a new shaft
for the oil engine, and set it in place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several hours were required to get the engine in good
condition, but they finally accomplished it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives had retreated.</p>

<p class='c000'>They then opened fire upon the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, their weapons were simply wasted against the
metal hull of the Pegasus, but they kept up the fusillade.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was necessary for somebody to go to the pilot-house to
cause the Pegasus to ascend, but a trip there from the deck-house
was now highly dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any of the poisoned missiles were apt to hit the one who
attempted to venture it and kill him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet it would not do to remain where they were too long,
or they might just as well abandon all hope of trying to
ever find the steamer again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank became desperate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He did not wish to injure the savages, but saw that only
by the most desperate measure could he hope to get the
engine up into the air again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly he went down to the ammunition-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he loaded a bombshell with a high explosive powder,
attached an electric wire to it and secured the other
end of the wire to one pole of the dynamo.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll scare them away temporarily!” he said to his
friends, “so when I give the word, complete the circuit in
the wire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, I’ll attind to that!” volunteered Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank opened the door and hurled the shell out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It rolled down a declivity to a safe distance from the
Pegasus, and Frank shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>These words had barely left his lips when a score or more
of the natives rushed up to the bomb to seize it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same juncture Barney obeyed Frank’s orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait!” shrieked the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>His warning came too late, however, for the electric current
flashed into the wire.</p>

<p class='c000'>There sounded an explosion that roared like a battery
of artillery, the burst shell blew every man to pieces who
surrounded it, and encompassed in a cloud of dirt, they
rose in the air, torn to fragments.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an awful warning to the rest, for they fled, yelling,
in all directions, and Frank took advantage of their
panic to rush up to the turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shutting himself in he started the helices whirling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pegasus straightened up and rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>She forced her way skyward, through the opening she had
first made among the trees, and quickly mounted to the
clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here she sped away to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she continued on over the course traversed by most
ships bound for the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several days passed uneventfully by when one morning
a yell came from Pomp in the turret, that startled every one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dar’s de Rover! Dar’s de Rover—a wreck!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His companions rushed out on deck and peered down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Floating on the ocean below was the dismantled wreck
of the trading steamer, and a man stood on her deck wildly
signaling to the crew of the engine of the clouds.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was very evident that the steamer had fallen victim
to the fury of the cyclone, so deplorable was her condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank studied her a few moments, then cried to Pomp:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go down to her; we will see what the man wants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sah!” replied the coon, causing the engine to descend.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Pegasus paused beside the steamer the man rushed
over to her side, and he saw that he was a sailor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For God’s sake, take me off!” he implored. “The
steamer has sprung a leak and may founder at any moment!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, come aboard!” said Frank, generously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ve got a good heart!” the man exclaimed, as he
boarded the engine. “I’m sorry I ever raised a hand against
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are your companions?” asked the inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All were taken aboard of a ship bound for Hong Kong.
I was left to my fate in the hold. The cyclone ruined the
ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was Martin Murdock with them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir,” replied the sailor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engine was then raised in the air and headed for
China.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank questioned the man and learned the details of their
fight with the storm and abandonment of the Rover.</p>

<p class='c000'>The airship was then headed for Hong Kong.</p>

<p class='c000'>She arrived there in due time and descended on the suburbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and the sailor alighted and going to the city they
sought the American consul.</p>

<p class='c000'>He told them that the shipwrecked crew had reached the
city in safety and all had been shipped for California on the
Pacific Mail steamer Confucius Kao, two days previously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was chagrined to learn that Murdock was among
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He left the sailor to find a berth and returned to where
he had left the Pegasus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hastening aboard he put her helices in motion and she
shot up into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up she flew to the clouds, then off she went for the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s friends joined him, and he explained what he
learned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must chase the Confucius across the Pacific,” said
he; “she is bound for San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Holy smoke! What a daisy run!” groaned Reynard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s back home Murdock bes goin’,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How yo’ ‘spects ter cotch dat yere steamah?” Pomp
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, by ascending into the Solar Current!” said Frank.
“Crippled as we are we could not overhaul her. But that
air current will add ten miles an hour to our speed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go up, by all means, then!” exclaimed the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Frank nodded, and sent the machine up several miles,
when they entered the great current and sped along faster.</p>

<p class='c000'>From their great elevation the voyagers could see the
ships they encountered by means of their telescopes, but
failed to observe any until they neared the American shores,
that tallied with the appearance of the Pacific mail steamers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made a computation of the time made, and was
delighted to find that they had gained considerably on
the Confucius Kao.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Allowing eighteen knots an hour for her speed,” said
he to his friends, “we ought to reach the Golden Gate almost
as soon as she does.”</p>

<p class='c000'>San Francisco came in view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they espied the steamer at anchor.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had beaten them in!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the final disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sure that Murdock had once more escaped them, they
lowered the engine of the clouds and Frank and the detective
alighted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inquiries soon developed the fact that the fugitive had
only passed on shore long enough to procure some new
clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had then taken passage on the Union Pacific Railroad
for the East, having purchased a ticket through to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Learning what train he was on, and the time it was due
in the White City, our friends hastened back to the flying
machine and resumed the pursuit relentlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Murdock had six hours, or over two hundred miles start
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away shot the Pegasus over the continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>By cutting across curves and resorting to similar measures,
our friends reduced the lead of the train.</p>

<p class='c000'>In two days they reached Chicago.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were ahead of the cars.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quick descent was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Reynard left the Pegasus and hastened to the
depot, where they arrived just as the train came in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both were intensely excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must not miss him now,” said the inventor. “We
have gone all around the world after that man, and it
would be terrible if we were to lose him at the last moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He won’t get away now!” grimly asserted the detective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here come the passengers. Keep your eyes open!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They stood aside as the people came thronging from the
cars, and watched every one closely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Frank drew a revolver.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There he is!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment he had jumped in front of Murdock,
taking him by surprise, and aimed his pistol at the man’s
head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are my prisoner, sir!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Caught, by heavens!” gasped the fugitive, turning pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hands up, or you are a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t fire! I surrender!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Up went Murdock’s hands, and Reynard handcuffed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some people tried to interfere, but a warrant for the
rascal’s arrest was shown, and they took him away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as they were about to leave the depot Barney and
Pomp came rushing up to them, pale and excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Masther Frank!” gasped the Irishman. “Ther Pegasus
is gone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gone!” echoed the inventor, in startled tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blowed up—smashed into a thousand pieces!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good heavens! How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yer see, ther naygur an’ I left her a few moments afther
you wint, an’ there suddenly sounded a terrible explosion
insoide av her. Ther next moment she wuz a wreck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What caused the explosion?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A can av that terrible powder, I’m thinkin’, wid which
you do be afther loadin’ ther bullets we used in ther guns.
It shtood on the edge av a shelf, an’ must have fell to ther
flure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As there was no means of ascertaining positively what
caused the explosion, and Barney’s idea was the most plausible,
Frank was forced to accept this theory.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was, in fact, right in his conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>They returned to where they had left the machine and
found a big crowd on the scene, attracted there by the
violent report.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the engine of the clouds was completely destroyed, they
could do nothing with the remains, and therefore left them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They reached the city with their prisoner, and put him
in jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a startling surprise awaited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief of police came in with little Joe Crosby, alive
and well.</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer to their startled inquiries about him, they
were told that Martin Murdock’s bullet had failed to do
its murderous work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy had fallen wounded and senseless.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Frank carried the detective into his house a resident
of Readestown had come along in a carriage, saw the
boy and took him into the vehicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Carrying him home and summoning a doctor, he had
maintained secrecy about the matter, and had the little
fellow completely cured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long after Frank had gone in pursuit of Murdock he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>had taken the boy back to Chicago and put his case into
the hands of the police.</p>

<p class='c000'>There Joe had been ever since.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he had perished Murdock would have been hung; as
it was, the villain was forced to make restitution, a new
guardian was appointed for the boy, and he prospered after
that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Martin Murdock was sentenced to prison for his rascality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Reynard returned to his official duties, pleased at
the way the affair had terminated, and Frank, Barney and
Pomp went home.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had their long chase around the world for nothing,
but did not regret it, as the perilous adventures they encountered
just suited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all were in good spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss of the Pegasus incited Frank to invent another
machine, and it was ultimately built and proved to be a
means of bringing him and his friends into the most exciting
adventures.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a future number of this weekly we will give our readers
an account of them, and so, for the present, will part
with our friends.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
